description: Programmatic access to session data via the agentsview session CLI and REST endpoints
---

The `agentsview session` command group is a stable, programmatic
surface for reading and writing session data. It is designed for
shell scripts, automation agents, and CI jobs that need structured
output rather than the web UI.

When an AgentsView server is running, the CLI proxies all supported
operations to it over HTTP. When no server is running, it opens the
local SQLite archive directly and calls the same service functions
the HTTP handler would have called — so results match regardless of
transport.

## Quick examples

```bash
# Search parsed message/tool content without scanning raw JSONL files.
agentsview session search "database timeout" --json --limit 10

# Recover recent context for one project, then fetch the first page
# of messages from a selected session.
agentsview session list --project myapp --limit 5 --json
agentsview session messages <session-id> --from 0 --limit 20 --json

# Query an already-running daemon explicitly.
agentsview session list --server http://127.0.0.1:8080 --json

# Read from configured PostgreSQL instead of local SQLite.
agentsview session search "regression" --pg --json
```

## Stability

- **Additive-only.** New fields may appear at any time. Existing
  fields are never renamed or removed.
- **Types are stable.** A field that is a string stays a string.
- **Unknown fields are safe to ignore.** Well-behaved consumers
  tolerate forward-compatible additions.

HTTP and CLI share DTOs for bounded responses (same JSON object).
The CLI `watch` command emits NDJSON whose lines mirror the
underlying SSE events.

## Transport

Detection uses the existing per-port state file
`$AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR/server.<port>.json`.

- If `--server <url>` is set, supported commands proxy to that
  daemon over HTTP. `--server` and `--pg` are mutually exclusive.
  The local config `auth_token` is not sent to explicit URLs; set
  `AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or pass `--server-token-file <path>`
  when that remote daemon requires auth.
- If no explicit server is set and a local daemon is running, read
  and write commands proxy to it over HTTP.
- If a [`pg serve`](/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve) daemon is
  running (read-only), read commands proxy to it but
  `session sync` refuses with a clear error.
- If both a writable local daemon and a `pg serve` daemon
  advertise the same data directory, the writable one wins so
  sync/write operations don't silently land on a read-only
  target.
- If no daemon is running, the CLI opens the local archive
  directly.
- `session export` always runs locally regardless of daemon
  state, and rejects `--server`, `--pg`, and `--format` because it
  streams raw source bytes.

When a discovered local daemon requires auth (`require_auth: true`),
the CLI attaches `Authorization: Bearer <token>` using the
`auth_token` from the shared config. Explicit `--server` URLs are
different: they only receive a bearer token supplied with
`AGENTSVIEW_SERVER_TOKEN` or `--server-token-file <path>`, so a
local daemon token is not leaked to arbitrary remote URLs. Prefer
`--server-token-file` for long-running commands and shared hosts so
the token does not appear in process arguments.

`--pg` opens the configured PostgreSQL read store directly. It is
useful for automation running away from the UI server, but it is
read-only: `session sync` and `session export` reject it. If
`AGENTSVIEW_PG_URL` or `[pg].url` is configured, read commands still
use local SQLite unless `--pg` is supplied.

## Common flags

| Flag                         | Description                                      |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `--format human\|json`       | Output format. Default `human`.                  |
| `--json`                     | Alias for `--format json`.                       |
| `--server <url>`             | Explicit daemon URL for HTTP-backed operations.  |
| `--server-token-file <path>` | Bearer token file for an explicit `--server` URL. |
| `--pg`                       | Read from configured PostgreSQL instead of SQLite. |

## Commands

### `agentsview session get`

Return session metadata plus computed signal fields. Shape matches
`GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}`.

```bash
agentsview session get <id> [--format json]
```

```json
{
  "id": "abc-123",
  "project": "myapp",
  "machine": "local",
  "agent": "claude",
  "first_message": "...",
  "display_name": "...",
  "started_at": "2026-04-18T12:00:00Z",
  "ended_at": "2026-04-18T13:00:00Z",
  "message_count": 42,
  "user_message_count": 7,
  "health_score": 85,
  "health_grade": "A",
  "outcome": "completed",
  "health_score_basis": ["..."],
  "health_penalties": {"tool_retries": 5},
  "secret_leak_count": 0
}
```

`health_score_basis` and `health_penalties` are populated when
`health_score` is non-null. Both HTTP and CLI surfaces return them.

`secret_leak_count` (added in 0.30.0) counts definite-tier
findings from [secret scanning](#secret-scanning) and is stamped
inline during sync. Candidate-tier findings only show up after
an explicit [`agentsview secrets scan --backfill`](/commands/#agentsview-secrets)
and do not contribute to this count.

---

### `agentsview session list`

Filtered session list. Response shape matches
`GET /api/v1/sessions`.

```bash
agentsview session list [flags]
```

```json
{
  "sessions": [ ... ],
  "next_cursor": "...",
  "total": 42
}
```

One-shot and automated sessions are excluded by default. Use the
`--include-*` flags to opt back in.

| Flag                  | HTTP param          | Notes                             |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------|
| `--project`           | `project`           | string                            |
| `--exclude-project`   | `exclude_project`   | string                            |
| `--machine`           | `machine`           | string                            |
| `--agent`             | `agent`             | string                            |
| `--date`              | `date`              | `YYYY-MM-DD`                      |
| `--date-from`         | `date_from`         | `YYYY-MM-DD`                      |
| `--date-to`           | `date_to`           | `YYYY-MM-DD`                      |
| `--active-since`      | `active_since`      | RFC3339 timestamp                 |
| `--resume`            | `active_since`      | CLI shortcut for sessions active in the last 15 minutes |
| `--active`            | `active_since`      | Alias for `--resume`              |
| `--min-messages`      | `min_messages`      | int                               |
| `--max-messages`      | `max_messages`      | int                               |
| `--min-user-messages` | `min_user_messages` | int                               |
| `--include-one-shot`  | `include_one_shot`  | bool                              |
| `--include-automated` | `include_automated` | bool                              |
| `--include-children`  | `include_children`  | bool                              |
| `--outcome`           | `outcome`           | comma-separated                   |
| `--health-grade`      | `health_grade`      | comma-separated                   |
| `--min-tool-failures` | `min_tool_failures` | int; `0` is a meaningful filter   |
| `--has-secret`        | `has_secret`        | bool — only sessions with at least one definite [secret finding](#secret-scanning) |
| `--sort`              | `order_by`          | comma-separated keys; optional `:asc` / `:desc` suffix per key |
| `--reverse`, `-r`     | `descending`        | flips the default direction for unsuffixed sort keys |
| `--cursor`            | `cursor`            | opaque string from prior response |
| `--limit`             | `limit`             | int; default 200, max 500         |

Sort keys are `recent`, `started`, `messages`, `user-messages`,
`output-tokens`, `peak-context`, `failures`, `retries`,
`edit-churn`, `compactions`, `context-pressure`, `health`,
`secrets`, and `id`. `recent` defaults descending; the other keys
default ascending unless `--reverse`, `descending=true`, or an
explicit suffix overrides them.

Human CLI output is formatted for resuming work: it shows the full
session ID, age, agent, project, branch, message count, title, and
working directory, with a marker on sessions active in the last 15
minutes. `--resume` and `--active` set `active_since` to that
15-minute window unless `--active-since` is supplied explicitly.
HTTP callers should pass `active_since` directly.

Examples:

```bash
agentsview session list --resume
agentsview session list --sort messages:desc,started:asc
agentsview session list --sort health --reverse
```

---

### `agentsview session messages`

Return a window of messages. Response shape matches
`GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/messages`.

```bash
agentsview session messages <id> [--from N] [--limit N] [--direction asc|desc]
```

`--from` is pointer-valued at the service layer: omitting it means
"start at the beginning" for ascending and "start at the newest
page" for descending; an explicit `--from 0` means "start at ordinal
0" in both directions. `--direction` is validated to `asc` or `desc`.

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "ordinal": 0,
      "role": "user",
      "content": "...",
      "thinking_text": "",
      "timestamp": "2026-04-18T12:00:00Z",
      "is_system": false,
      "source_type": "user",
      "source_subtype": "",
      "has_thinking": false,
      "has_tool_use": false
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

`thinking_text` holds the concatenated text of any `thinking` blocks
the agent emitted, separated from the flattened `content` which
still contains inline `[Thinking]...[/Thinking]` markers for UI
rendering.

Promoted `source_subtype` values on `is_system: true` messages:
`continuation`, `resume`, `interrupted`, `task_notification`,
`stop_hook`, `compact_boundary`.

---

### `agentsview session tool-calls`

Chronological flattened list of tool invocations.

```bash
agentsview session tool-calls <id>
```

```json
{
  "tool_calls": [
    {
      "ordinal": 3,
      "timestamp": "2026-04-18T12:05:00Z",
      "tool_use_id": "toolu_01abc...",
      "tool_name": "Bash",
      "category": "Bash",
      "input_json": "{\"command\":\"ls\"}",
      "skill_name": "",
      "subagent_session_id": "",
      "result_length": 128
    }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

`input_json` is a string — usually a serialized JSON object but may
be a plain string (e.g. `"echo hello world"` from Codex).

---

### `agentsview session export`

Stream the raw session source file to stdout. This is a
**local-only** filesystem helper: the source file path is resolved
from the local SQLite archive, never from any daemon. Both
`--server` and `--format` are rejected with an error — the command
also rejects `--pg`. It streams raw bytes, so structured-output
and remote-store flags don't apply.

```bash
agentsview session export <id>
```

Exit states:

| State                                  | Behavior                                                  |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Session in local archive, file on disk | Streams bytes verbatim                                    |
| Session in local archive, file missing | Exit 1: error prefixed `source file not found`            |
| Session in local archive, path empty   | Exit 1: `source file not found for session <id>`          |
| Session not in local archive           | Exit 1: `session not in local archive: <id>`              |

For a DB-derived export (HTML or markdown) use the HTTP endpoints
`/api/v1/sessions/{id}/export` or `/api/v1/sessions/{id}/md`.

Markdown export accepts an optional `depth` query parameter:

- omitted: root session only
- `depth=1`: include direct child/subagent sessions
- `depth=all`: recurse through the child-session tree

Any other `depth` value is rejected.

---

### `agentsview session sync`

Parse and insert a single session. Blocks until indexing and signal
computation complete. JSON output is the `SessionDetail` of the
synced session; human output is one line: `synced: <id>`.

```bash
agentsview session sync <path-or-id>
```

Argument resolution: if the argument is an existing filesystem
path, it is treated as a raw JSONL file to parse. Otherwise it is
treated as a session ID for re-parse.

With `--server <url>`, path-shaped arguments such as
`/var/log/agent/session.jsonl` or `./session.jsonl` are sent to the
remote daemon as paths and resolved on that daemon host. Bare values
without path separators are treated as session IDs.

When a single JSONL maps to more than one session (for example a
Claude transcript with forked/resumed branches), `session sync
<path>` refuses with an error that lists every candidate id. The
contract is "one session in, one `SessionDetail` back", so the CLI
never picks arbitrarily.

At that point the file has already been parsed and every candidate
session written to the local archive — the ambiguity check runs
after the sync engine finishes. Re-run `session sync <id>` with the
specific session you want; the `<id>` form resolves the file path
from the archive, so it only works for sessions already present
there.

- If a local daemon is running, syncs proxy to
  `POST /api/v1/sessions/sync` to avoid racing signal computation.
- If a [`pg serve`](/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve) daemon is
  running (read-only), sync refuses with a clear error.
- If no daemon is running, the CLI runs the sync in-process.

---

### `agentsview session watch`

Stream NDJSON events as the session updates. Each line is a small
object that wraps an SSE event.

```bash
agentsview session watch <id>
```

```
{"event":"session_updated","data":"abc-123"}
{"event":"heartbeat","data":"2026-04-18T12:05:00Z"}
```

Recognized `event` values today: `session_updated`, `heartbeat`.
New events may be added; consumers should ignore unknown events.
The command runs until interrupted (Ctrl+C) or the context is
cancelled.

Watch validates the session id before opening the stream. An
unknown id fails fast with a `watch: session not found: <id>`
error and non-zero exit instead of producing an indefinite
heartbeat stream — typos in automation scripts surface immediately.
When proxied to a daemon, the same condition surfaces as HTTP 404
at the transport layer before being translated to the CLI error.

---

### `agentsview session search`

Substring, RE2 regex, or FTS5 search across message bodies,
tool inputs, and tool result content. Response shape matches
`GET /api/v1/search/content`.

```bash
agentsview session search <pattern> [flags]
```

```json
{
  "matches": [
    {
      "session_id": "abc-123",
      "project": "myapp",
      "ordinal": 17,
      "location": "tool_result",
      "tool_name": "Bash",
      "snippet": "...connecting to db with token ***REDACTED***..."
    }
  ]
}
```

One-shot, automated, and subagent sessions are excluded by
default; opt back in with `--include-one-shot`,
`--include-automated`, or `--include-children`.

| Flag                  | HTTP param          | Notes                                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `--regex`             | `mode=regex`        | Treat pattern as an RE2 regex                          |
| `--fts`               | `mode=fts`          | Tokenized FTS5 search; messages-only                   |
| `--in`                | `in`                | Comma-separated: `messages,tool_input,tool_result` (default all) |
| `--exclude-system`    | `exclude_system`    | Drop system messages from the scan                     |
| `--reveal`            | `reveal`            | Show full secret values (localhost-only; warning to stderr) |
| `--project`           | `project`           | string                                                 |
| `--exclude-project`   | `exclude_project`   | string                                                 |
| `--machine`           | `machine`           | string                                                 |
| `--agent`             | `agent`             | string                                                 |
| `--date`              | `date`              | `YYYY-MM-DD`                                           |
| `--date-from`         | `date_from`         | `YYYY-MM-DD`                                           |
| `--date-to`           | `date_to`           | `YYYY-MM-DD`                                           |
| `--active-since`      | `active_since`      | RFC3339 timestamp                                      |
| `--include-children`  | `include_children`  | bool                                                   |
| `--include-automated` | `include_automated` | bool                                                   |
| `--include-one-shot`  | `include_one_shot`  | bool                                                   |
| `--limit`             | `limit`             | int; default 50, max 500                               |
| `--cursor`            | `cursor`            | int — pagination cursor from a previous response       |

`--regex` and `--fts` are mutually exclusive. `--fts` is the
fastest mode on large archives but only searches message bodies;
substring (the default) and regex modes also walk
`tool_calls.input_json`, `tool_calls.result_content`, and the
`tool_result_events` rows.

Snippets carry ~60 characters of context on each side of the
match, snapped to rune boundaries. Any substring that matches
the [secret scanner](#secret-scanning) rule set is masked unless
`--reveal` is passed. The same masking applies to the HTTP
endpoint when called from a remote origin — `reveal=true` is
only honored on a localhost-bound daemon.

---

### `agentsview session usage`

Per-session token usage and cost estimate. Output shape is
stable for the fields shown below; new fields may be added.

```bash
agentsview session usage <id> [--format json]
```

```json
{
  "session_id": "abc-123",
  "agent": "claude",
  "project": "myapp",
  "total_output_tokens": 15230,
  "peak_context_tokens": 84000,
  "has_token_data": true,
  "cost_usd": 2.41,
  "has_cost": true,
  "models": ["claude-opus-4-7"],
  "unpriced_models": [],
  "server_running": false
}
```

| Field                 | Notes                                                                |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `total_output_tokens` | Sum of generated output tokens across the session                    |
| `peak_context_tokens` | Highest context-token count observed during the session              |
| `has_token_data`      | `false` when the session has no per-message token usage              |
| `cost_usd`            | Model-pricing estimate in USD; `0` when `has_cost` is `false`        |
| `has_cost`            | `false` if any contributing row is unpriced — never reports a partial total as complete |
| `models`              | Models that contributed to the cost estimate, sorted by model name      |
| `unpriced_models`     | Omitted from JSON when empty; lists models seen but missing from pricing |
| `server_running`      | `true` when the report came from an already-running daemon           |

Human output is a five-line summary:

```
Session:       abc-123
Agent:         claude
Output:        15230
Peak ctx:      84000
Cost:          ~$2.41 (claude-opus-4-7)
```

The leading `~` on the cost line marks the figure as a
model-pricing estimate. When some contributing models are
unpriced, the cost line reads `n/a (unpriced: model-x)`; when
the session has no token data at all, it reads `n/a`.

**HTTP endpoint** — as of 0.32.0, the same data is available
over REST:

```http
GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/usage
```

The response uses the same JSON fields shown above and is
available from both local SQLite-backed `agentsview serve` and
read-only [`agentsview pg serve`](/pg-sync/#agentsview-pg-serve).
HTTP responses set `server_running: true`. Existing sessions
return `200 OK` even when token or cost data is absent; inspect
`has_token_data`, `has_cost`, and `unpriced_models` to decide
how to present that state. Missing sessions return `404` with:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "session_not_found",
    "message": "session not found"
  }
}
```

Unexpected usage-query failures return `500` with
`error.code = "usage_query_failed"`.

**Exit codes** — `usage` keeps the older `token-use` contract:

| Code | Meaning                                       |
|------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `0`  | Token data or cost present and reported       |
| `2`  | Session not found in the local archive        |
| `3`  | Session exists but has neither token data nor cost |

The command uses the local SQLite archive plus an on-demand
sync when no daemon is running (with a 30-second wait if a
startup lock is held). With `--server`, it calls
`GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/usage` on the explicit daemon. With
`--pg`, it reads usage from the shared PostgreSQL store.

Pricing comes from the same `model_pricing` table and
[custom pricing overrides](/token-usage/#custom-model-pricing)
that back `agentsview usage daily`. Replaces the older
[`agentsview token-use`](/commands/#agentsview-token-use), which
remains as a deprecated alias.

## Activity Report

The Activity report endpoint powers the top-level
[Activity](/activity/) page and the `agentsview activity report`
CLI command. It returns one resolved range with concurrency buckets,
summary totals, breakdowns, and contributing sessions.

```http
GET /api/v1/activity/report
```

Activity includes one-shot sessions by default. Automated sessions
are also included by default and can be filtered with the
`automation` query parameter.

| Query param | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| `preset` | `day`, `week`, `month`, or `custom` |
| `date` | Anchor date for day/week/month presets (`YYYY-MM-DD`) |
| `from` | Custom range start, RFC3339 |
| `to` | Custom range end, RFC3339 |
| `timezone` | IANA timezone name; default `UTC` |
| `bucket` | Optional bucket override: `5m`, `15m`, `1h`, `1d`, or `1w` |
| `project` | Filter by project |
| `agent` | Filter by agent |
| `machine` | Filter by machine |
| `automation` | `all`, `interactive`, or `automated`; default `all` |

```

Breakdown rows include total, automated, and interactive minutes and
costs. Session rows with no reliable timestamped activity use
`"timing_quality": "untimed"` and `agent_minutes: null`; they can
still contribute cost and output tokens when usage rows exist.

## Secret Scanning

As of 0.30.0, AgentsView scans session content for credentials
during sync and exposes findings through CLI, HTTP, and per-
session metadata. Two confidence tiers exist:

| Tier | Rules | When scanned |
|------|-------|--------------|
| **Definite** | Well-anchored vendor formats: AWS access keys, Anthropic `sk-ant-…`, OpenAI `sk-proj-`/`sk-svcacct-`/`sk-admin-`, GitHub `ghp_…` and `github_pat_…`, GitLab `glpat-…`, Slack `xoxb`/`xoxa`/`xoxp`/`xoxr`/`xoxs`, Stripe `sk_live_…` and `rk_live_…`, Google `AIza…`, npm `npm_…`, PyPI `pypi-…`, Hugging Face `hf_…`, SendGrid `SG.…`, PEM private-key blocks | Inline during sync |
| **Candidate** | FP-prone heuristics: basic-auth URLs, JWTs, high-entropy assignments | Only when `agentsview secrets scan` runs explicitly |

Findings are written to a `secret_findings` table keyed by
session ID, with the rule name, confidence, location
(message / tool_input / tool_result / tool_result_event),
match coordinates, and a `redacted_match` value (the raw
secret is never stored). Each session also carries a
`secret_leak_count` and a `secrets_rules_version` so a future
ruleset bump can drive an incremental backfill.

### HTTP API

```
GET /api/v1/secrets
POST /api/v1/secrets/scan
GET /api/v1/search/content    (when called with text that matches a secret rule, snippets are masked)
```

`GET /api/v1/secrets` accepts: `project`, `agent`, `date_from`,
`date_to`, `rule`, `confidence` (`definite` / `candidate` /
`all`, default `definite`), `reveal`, `limit`, `cursor`.
`reveal=true` is only honored on a localhost-bound daemon —
remote callers that request reveal receive HTTP 403.

`POST /api/v1/secrets/scan` streams progress with
Server-Sent Events and accepts `backfill`, `project`, `agent`,
`date_from`, and `date_to`. It is only available from a
writable local daemon.

### Listing sessions with findings

`agentsview session list --has-secret` (or `has_secret=true` on
`GET /api/v1/sessions`) returns only sessions with at least one
definite finding. The candidate tier does not contribute to
`secret_leak_count` and so does not surface through this filter.

### CLI

The [`agentsview secrets`](/commands/#agentsview-secrets) command
group wraps the scan and list operations. The fast path is:

```bash
# Re-scan the archive with the full ruleset (definite + candidate)
agentsview secrets scan

# List definite findings (redacted; localhost-only --reveal for raw values)
agentsview secrets list
agentsview secrets list --reveal
```

### PostgreSQL parity

When [PostgreSQL sync](/pg-sync/) is enabled, the
`secret_findings` table, the session-level `secret_leak_count`,
and the `--has-secret` filter all mirror to the shared
database. Substring and regex content search work the same way
against `pg serve`, with the same masking and `--reveal`
constraints.
