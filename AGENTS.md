# AGENTS.md

Instructions for autonomous coding agents working in this repository.

## Scope

- Applies to all agent-driven work in this repo.
- If multiple instruction files exist, follow the most specific one for the
  files you are editing.
- Requests to review, analyze, or explain are read-only unless the user also
  asks for changes.
- `AGENTS.md` is the source of truth for standing rules; keep `CLAUDE.md` as a
  symlink to it and record new durable rules here.

## Roborev

- Never invoke the `roborev review` CLI command in any form unless the user
  explicitly asks for it. Use all other `roborev` CLI commands normally when
  they are appropriate for interacting with roborev. Never invoke a roborev
  skill (including `roborev-fix` or `roborev-design-review-branch`) unless the
  user explicitly asks for that skill.

## Required Git Rules

1. Commit every turn that changes tracked files.
1. Do not make empty commits. If a turn is read-only or only changes ignored
   files, state that no commit was made.
1. Do not amend, squash, or rebase commits unless explicitly requested.
1. Do not change branches without explicit user permission.
1. Deliver changes through pull requests from feature branches.
1. Do not merge pull requests. Open them and report status; merging is always
   the user's decision, even when checks are green and the change is urgent.

## Commit Expectations

- Keep commits focused and related to the requested task.
- Use clear conventional commit messages.
- Do not push, pull, or rebase unless explicitly requested.
- Do not include generated-with lines, attribution blocks, validation footers,
  or command transcripts in commit messages.

## Content Hygiene

- Keep private project names, hostnames, personal identities, infrastructure
  details, and absolute user paths out of code, tests, fixtures, docs, commit
  messages, and pull request text. Run the private-data scrub before
  publishing.
- Keep pull request titles and descriptions synchronized with the current diff.
- Do not post pull request or issue comments unless explicitly requested.

## Validation

- Run relevant tests before committing when practical.
- If tests cannot be run, state that clearly in the handoff.
- After Go code changes, run `go fmt ./...` and `go vet ./...` before
  committing.

## Background Memory

- Keep passive daemon memory within a few hundred megabytes on macOS, Linux, and
  Windows. Treat sustained growth beyond that range as a regression.
- Background watcher, polling, and sync work must be bounded by the changed
  batch, not by total archive size. Do not scan or materialize every stored
  session for each filesystem event.
- Declare expensive scheduling inputs as provider capabilities and compute them
  only for providers that observably consume them. Default new capabilities to
  unsupported.
- Add cardinality-scaling regressions for background paths: compare small and
  large archives and assert that unchanged per-event work remains bounded.
  Preserve deletion, tombstone, and persistent-archive behavior in the same
  tests.
- Diagnose long-running memory with allocation and CPU profiles plus live heap,
  forced-GC heap, and operating-system physical/dirty memory. Raw RSS alone is
  not proof of live memory because it includes clean reclaimable mappings.
- Profile branch binaries only against isolated production-scale database and
  source clones. Never point profiling workloads at live archives or live
  agent transcripts.
- Include a retention observation long enough to reproduce the reported growth
  window. On macOS record `vmmap` physical footprint and dirty memory; use
  portable Go allocation and heap metrics for Linux and Windows.

## Backend Parity

- Preserve behavior and query-shape parity between supported storage backends
  whenever practical. SQLite and PostgreSQL/Cockroach queries, indexes,
  aggregations, filtering, and ordering should match until there is a
  concrete, documented reason for them to differ.
- Do not implement a performance or correctness fix for only one backend and
  call the problem solved unless the user explicitly scopes the work to that
  backend, for example "this is only for PostgreSQL". If one backend needs a
  different implementation, explain why and keep the observable behavior the
  same.

## DuckDB Mirror

- DuckDB is a disposable read mirror of the SQLite archive, never a system of
  record. Backend Parity above applies to SQLite and PostgreSQL only; DuckDB
  is derived data and must stay rebuildable from SQLite at any time.
- The mirror has no in-place schema migrations. A mirror schema or source
  data-version change bumps `internal/duckdb.SchemaVersion` and forces a full
  rebuild into a fresh file that is validated and atomically swapped in. Do
  not add ALTER-style migrations, version-bridging reads, or compatibility
  shims for old mirror files.
- All DuckDB push state (cutoff, revisions, scope, machine, versions) lives in
  the mirror's own `sync_metadata`. Never store DuckDB sync cursors in SQLite;
  deleting the mirror file must lose nothing.
- Incremental updates are whole-session replace only, gated by per-session
  fingerprints. Do not add per-table, per-column, or diff-based incremental
  sync to the mirror.
- Quack is read-side only. `duckdb push` writes the local mirror file; there is
  no remote DuckDB push and none should be added.
- Never overwrite an existing file that is not positively identified as an
  agentsview DuckDB mirror; unrecognized destinations fail closed.

## Provider Format Provenance

When adding a provider, changing its format or usage/cost accounting, or
investigating a provider release, new artifact generation, parser bug, or usage
discrepancy, consult `docs/internal/session-format-sources.md` and reverify or
update its evidence entry in the same change. Grok remains temporarily excluded
only until its separately owned format-alignment work lands.

## Localization

- Keep frontend message catalogs synchronized. When adding, removing, or
  renaming user-facing message keys in `frontend/messages/*.json`, update
  every locale listed in `frontend/project.inlang/settings.json` in the same
  turn and keep the key sets identical across locales.
- After message catalog or localized component changes, run
  `npm run i18n:compile` and `npm run check` from `frontend/` when practical.

## Test Style

- Go tests use `github.com/stretchr/testify` for assertions. Use `require.X`
  when a failed check should abort the test (setup, nil receivers, length
  checks before indexing) and `assert.X` for independent checks that should
  keep running. Don't write `if got != want { t.Fatalf(...) }` in new tests.
- Domain-specific helpers are fine, but they must use testify internally rather
  than stdlib comparisons.

## Safety

- Do not revert user-authored or unrelated local changes unless explicitly
  requested.
- Avoid destructive git commands unless explicitly requested.
- Never install over a live binary, run migrations against a production
  database, or write to live data directories without explicit permission.
  Point branch builds and profiling runs at isolated scratch data.
- For login or OAuth flows, give the user the exact command to run rather than
  driving the interactive authentication flow.
- The SQLite database is a persistent archive. Never delete, drop, truncate, or
  recreate it to handle data version changes. Schema changes use
  non-destructive migrations such as `ALTER TABLE` and `UPDATE`; parser
  changes trigger a full resync that builds a fresh DB, syncs files, copies
  orphaned sessions from the old DB, and swaps atomically. Existing session
  data must be preserved even when source files no longer exist on disk.

## Project Overview

agentsview is a local web viewer for AI agent sessions. It syncs session data
from disk into SQLite with FTS5 full-text search, serves a Svelte 5 SPA via an
embedded Go HTTP server, and provides real-time updates via SSE. See
`internal/parser/types.go` for the full list of supported agents.

## Architecture

```text
CLI (agentsview) -> Config -> DB (SQLite/FTS5)
                  |           |
                  v           v
              File Watcher -> Sync Engine -> Parsers (per agent)
                  |           |
                  v           v
              HTTP Server -> REST API + SSE + Embedded SPA
                              |
                              v
                           PG Push Sync -> PostgreSQL (optional)
                              ^
                              |
              HTTP Server (pg serve) <- PostgreSQL
```

- Server: HTTP server with auto-port discovery, defaulting to 8080.
- Storage: SQLite with WAL mode, FTS5 for full-text search, and optional
  PostgreSQL for multi-machine shared access.
- Sync: file watcher plus periodic sync every 15 minutes for session
  directories.
- PG sync: on-demand push sync from SQLite to PostgreSQL via `pg push`.
- Frontend: Svelte 5 SPA embedded in the Go binary at build time.
- Config: `AGENTSVIEW_DATA_DIR` plus per-agent directory overrides and CLI
  flags. Per-agent env vars are listed on each entry in
  `internal/parser/types.go`.

## Development

```bash
make build          # Build binary with embedded frontend
make dev            # Run Go server in dev mode
make frontend       # Build frontend SPA only
make frontend-dev   # Run Vite dev server, use alongside make dev
make install        # Build and install to ~/.local/bin or GOPATH
make install-hooks  # Install pre-commit and pre-push git hooks
```

## Testing

All new features and bug fixes must include unit tests. Run tests before
committing:

```bash
make test       # Go tests with CGO_ENABLED=1 and -tags "fts5"
make test-short # Fast tests only with -short
make e2e        # Playwright E2E tests
make lint       # golangci-lint plus NilAway
make vet        # go vet
```

## Test Style

- Prefer table-driven tests for Go code.
- Go tests use `github.com/stretchr/testify` for assertions.
- Use `require.X` when a failed check should abort the test, including setup
  errors, nil receivers, and length checks before indexing.
- Use `assert.X` for independent checks that should keep running.
- Do not write `if got != want { t.Fatalf(...) }` in new tests.
- Domain-specific helpers are fine, but they must use testify internally rather
  than stdlib comparisons.
- Use the existing `testDB(t)` helper for database tests.
- Frontend tests are colocated `*.test.ts` files, with Playwright specs in
  `frontend/e2e/`.
- All tests use `t.TempDir()` for temp directories.
- Shell script tests must exercise observable behavior by running the script
  against controlled inputs and asserting outputs, side effects, or exit
  codes. Do not write tautological tests that read a shell script and assert
  that it contains a specific implementation line, flag, or snippet.

## PostgreSQL Integration Tests

PG integration tests require a real PostgreSQL instance and the `pgtest` build
tag. The easiest way to run them is with docker-compose:

```bash
make test-postgres   # Starts PG container, runs tests, leaves container running
make postgres-down   # Stop the test container when done
```

Or manually with an existing PostgreSQL instance:

```bash
TEST_PG_URL="postgres://user:pass@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=disable" \
  CGO_ENABLED=1 go test -tags "fts5,pgtest" ./internal/postgres/... -v
```

Tests create and drop the `agentsview` schema, so use a dedicated database or
one where schema changes are acceptable. The CI pipeline runs these tests via a
GitHub Actions service container in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## Build Requirements

- `CGO_ENABLED=1` is required for the sqlite3 driver.
- The `fts5` build tag is required for full-text search.
- `go test` does not need kit's `kit_posthog_disabled` build tag. The telemetry
  reporter already short-circuits to a disabled no-op under
  `testing.Testing()`, so tests never send PostHog events. Binaries built for
  e2e tests (`make e2e`, the CI pre-build of `agentsview`/`testfixture`) do
  use the tag, because they run as real processes where the test guard does
  not apply.
- Node.js and npm are required to build the Svelte frontend embedded under
  `internal/web/dist/`.
- The frontend depends on `@kenn-io/kit-ui` as a git dependency pinned to a
  commit (`git+https://github.com/kenn-io/kit-ui.git#<commit>` in
  `frontend/package.json`). The repository is public, so `npm ci`/
  `npm install` clone it anonymously over HTTPS with no credentials; the only
  requirement is git on PATH. The lockfile records the dependency as
  `git+ssh://git@github.com/...` — that is npm's canonical form for
  GitHub-hosted git deps and cannot be changed, but npm still fetches over
  anonymous HTTPS (verified with SSH disabled and a cold cache); do not "fix"
  it. Bump the dependency by changing the commit hash in `frontend/package.json`
  and running `npm install`.

## Conventions

- Prefer stdlib over external dependencies.
- Tests should be fast and isolated.
- No emojis in code or output.
- For frontend UI work, read `DESIGN.md` before adding or changing controls,
  styling, or reusable components.
- Use `mdformat --wrap 80` to format Markdown files when mdformat and
  `mdformat-tables` are available.

## Pull Requests

- PR descriptions should be summaries only, with no test plans or checklists. Do
  not add a "Tests", "Testing", "Verification", or "Test plan" section. CI
  runs the tests, so the description must not restate the suite, list test
  commands, or describe how the change was verified.
- Describe what the code does now, why it changed, tradeoffs, limitations, and
  where reviewers should look.
